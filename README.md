## 🎯 What I'm Doing

**Building the Agent Factory** – Creating reusable intelligence through Agent Skills and SubAgents that can be deployed across multiple projects. Focusing on the convergence of General Agents (Claude Code) and Custom Agents (OpenAI/Claude SDKs).

**Mastering Cloud-Native AI** – Implementing Kubernetes-based deployments, event-driven architectures with Kafka and Dapr, and AIOps practices using kubectl-ai and kagent.

**Spec-Driven Everything** – Writing specifications first, letting AI generate implementations. This shifts the role from "syntax writer" to "system architect."

---

## 🤝 Open for Projects

I'm available for freelance projects involving:

- **Digital FTE Development** – Building AI employees that work 24/7 on specific business processes
- **AI Agent Solutions** – Custom agents for automation, customer support, data processing, or specialized workflows
- **Full-Stack AI Applications** – End-to-end development of AI-powered web applications
- **RAG & MCP Implementations** – Conversational AI systems with access to proprietary data and tools
- **Spec-Driven Development Consulting** – Helping teams adopt AI-native development workflows

**Approach:** I use spec-driven development to ensure clear requirements, predictable timelines, and maintainable codebases. Every implementation maps back to explicit specifications.

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Ship beats perfect" – I build tools to solve real problems, then share them with the community. Currently exploring how AI transforms software development from typing code to orchestrating intelligent systems.

Focus areas: **Agentic workflows**, **Spec-driven architecture**, **Cloud-native AI**, **Digital automation**
